          <p>Sick of frantically clicking back and forth between your Recruits and your Spells? Worry no more!</p>
          <p>You can now cast <b>Spells</b> using the <b>Number Keys</b>:</p>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>(1)</b> will cast the first spell on your <b>Spell Bar</b>, <b>(2)</b> will cast the second spell, etc...</p>
          <p>You can also change <b>Target</b> with the <b>Arrow Keys</b>:</p>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>(Up)</b> and <b>(Down)</b> will swap between Targeting your <b>Recruits</b> and your <b>Player Character</b></p>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>(Left)</b> and <b>(Right)</b> will shift along your <b>Recruits</b> as Targets</p>
