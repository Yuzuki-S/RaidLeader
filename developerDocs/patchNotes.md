## Patch 0.5.0

### The Armory!
<div className="content is-medium has-text-dark">
  <p><b>The Armory</b> is (finally) in development!</p>
  <p>This new dungeon is available during it's development, and bosses will be released as time progresses.</p>
  <p>To enter The Armory you must clear <b>The Foundry</b> on your account. You may bring <b>4 Spells</b> and <b>4 Recruits</b> to this new dungeon!</p>
  <p>Currently there is one boss awaiting testing: <b>Percy the Pirate!</b></p>
  <p>Be sure to read the Boss Descriptions :)</p>
</div>

### Stranded Recruits
<div className="content is-medium has-text-dark">
  <p>Occassionally when defeating a Boss your may rescue a <b>Stranded Recruit</b>!</p>
  <p>These recruits will join your party upon rescue, and their Level will be based on the Boss' Level</p>
  <p>This should naturally increase your options as you assemble your teams, where previously the desire to hoard gold would keep your options low.</p>
  <p>Some bosses will only reward <b>Stranded Recruits</b> of specific Classes</p>
  <p>Different Bosses will have differing chances to reward <b>Stranded Recruits</b>, but the default chance is <b>%15</b> (Subject to change)</p>
</div>

### Tier 4 Spells!

  <p>At the <b>Mage Tower</b> you will find a new Tier of Traits to spend your <b>Gems</b> on.</p>
  <p>These <b>Tier 4 Spells</b> are some kick-ass new Spells for you to work towards, and they have some powerful effects.</p>

  <p>These Spells are intended to be Powerful, costly effects, and they are totally <b>NOT YET TESTED</b></p>
  <p>So be sure to let me know if they feel too Strong or too Weak. Feedback is much appreciated</p>
  <p>Also let me know if they feel too hard to get to in the first place, 4 Gems can take some time to gather.</p>

  </div>

### New Effects; Stunned and Bomb
  <div className="content is-medium has-text-dark">
    <p>In Preparation for developing <b>The Armory</b>, I've been hard at work on several New and Interesting Effects</p>
    <br />
    <p><b>Stunned:</b> A Stunned Recruit cannot Attack. The Recruit's Attack timer will continue to 'tick' during the stun, but any <b>Completed</b> Attacks will not happen while <b>Stunned</b></p>
    <br />
    <p><b>Bomb:</b> A Bomb Effect can be placed on a Recruit. The Bomb will <b>Explode</b> when it <b>Expires</b>, damagin <b>All Recruits</b> for a specified Health % (default is 20%)</p>
    <br />
    <p>If you want to try out the new Effects, there are several new Spells that utilise them in interesting ways</p>

## 0.4.1

### Database Reset!
  <div className="content is-medium has-text-dark">
    <p><b>Apologies for destroying your precious progress!</b></p>
    <p>During development this will need to happen from time to time, but I am putting measures in place to prevent this being necessary in the future.</p>
    <p>For those of you with Level 6 Armies, this is a good chance to go through and retest the game more fairly :)</p>
    <p>As much as the <b>Patch Number</b> may suggest, this is not an April Fools Joke</p>
  </div>

### Player Leveling
  <div className="content is-medium has-text-dark">
    <p>A new feature is in the works, and it involves gaining <b>experience</b> and <b>leveling</b> up your Player Character.</p>
    <p>Leveling will provide you with a special currencey which you can use to purchase traits / upgrades.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Leveling and experience gains are functional, and you will gain <b>1 Gem</b> every time you level up.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Experience Required to Level Up increases by 10% of the previous levels EXP Requirement. (1000, 1100, 1210).</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Defeating a Boss within a dungeon has a <b>Chance</b> to reward a <b>Gem</b>, this chance is reduced for every <b>Recruit</b> that was higher than the Dungeon's <b>Expected Level</b>. Harder Dungeons have a <b>Higher Chances of Gems</b></p>
    <br />
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - You can spend the <b>Gems</b> that you have earned at the <b>Mage Tower</b></p>
    <p>Let me know if you run into any EXP related bugs</p>
  </div>

### Mage Tower Added!
  <div className="content is-medium has-text-dark">
    <p>The <b>Mage Tower</b> is a new Menu you will find in <b>Town</b></p>
    <p>At the Mage Tower you can spend the <b>Gems</b> that you have earned on your adventure</p>
    <p>You will find <b>4</b> different <b>"Trees"</b>, one for each element</p>
    <p>In each tree you will find <b>Spells</b> that you can learn, or <b>Passive Traits</b> which will empower you <b>Player and/or Recruits</b> in various ways for the <b>Rest of your Adventure</b></p>
    <p>As unlock <b>Traits</b> for a Element Type, you will be able to purchase more <b>Expensive</b> but <b>Powerful</b> Traits and Spells further down the Tree</p>
    <br />
    <p>There are some <b>Wild</b> combinations to build towards to make you the <b>Most Powerful Raid Leader!</b></p>
  </div>

### Speed Scaling Changes
  <div className="content is-medium has-text-dark">
    <p>Some Classes, namely <b>Bard</b> and <b>Shaman</b> have very powerful Traits at the cost of having low Power / Speed.</p>
    <p>This meant that a Shaman with a <b>+20% Speed Zodiac</b> was amazing, but a <b>-20% Speed Zodiac</b> was terrible.</p>
    <p>To fix this, I have changed the <b>Traits</b> of the <b>Bard and Shaman</b></p>
    <p><b>Bard</b>:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <b>Previous Trait</b>: Whenever the Bard attacks, restore 1 Mana to the Player</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <b>New Trait</b>: The Bard's attacks have a chance to restore 3 Mana to the Player. (This chance scales with the Bard's Speed and will occur roughly once per 10 seconds.)</p>
    <p><b>Shaman</b>:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <b>Previous Trait</b>: "The Shaman's attacks also place a Renew effect on a friendly recruit with the lowest health %, healing for 60% of Target's Max Health over 15 seconds</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <b>New Trait</b>: The Shaman's attacks have a chance to place a Renew effect on a friendly recruit with the lowest health %, healing for 60% of Target's Max Health over 15 seconds. (This chance scales with the Shaman's Speed and will occur roughly once per 10 seconds.)</p>
  </div>
