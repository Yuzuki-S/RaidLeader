### Stranded Recruits
<div className="content is-medium has-text-dark">
  <p>Occassionally when defeating a Boss your may rescue a <b>Stranded Recruit</b>!</p>
  <p>These recruits will join your party upon rescue, and their Level will be based on the Boss' Level</p>
  <p>This should naturally increase your options as you assemble your teams, where previously the desire to hoard gold would keep your options low.</p>
  <p>Some bosses will only reward <b>Stranded Recruits</b> of specific Classes</p>
  <p>Different Bosses will have differing chances to reward <b>Stranded Recruits</b>, but the default chance is <b>%15</b> (Subject to change)</p>
